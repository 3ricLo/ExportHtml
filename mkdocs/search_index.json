Or you can create commands directly outside of the settings file bound to the command palette, key bindings, or even the menu.\n\n\nIf adding a command to the settings file, it goes under the \nhtml_panel\n setting.  These configurations will appear under the \nExport to HTML: Show Export Menu\n command palette command.\n\n\n// Define configurations for the drop down export menu\n\n\nhtml_panel\n:\n \n[\n\n    \n// Browser print color (selections and multi-selections allowed)\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nBrowser Print - Color\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nnumbers\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n            \nwrap\n:\n \n900\n,\n\n            \nbrowser_print\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n            \nmulti_select\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n            \ncolor_scheme\n:\n \nPackages/ExportHtml/ColorSchemes/Print-Color.tmTheme\n,\n\n            \nstyle_gutter\n:\n \nfalse\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the command is the key value, and then you add the parameters you wish to specify.  You can use any combination of settings below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumbers\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nDisplay line numbers in the gutter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstyle_gutter\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nStyle gutter with theme backgrounds and foregrounds, or just use the default background/foreground.  Default is \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmulti_select\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nIf multiple regions are selected in a document, only export what is under those selections. By default only the first selection is recognized.  Default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhighlight_selections\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nHighlights all selections in HTML output using the themes selection colors.  Multi-select option will be ignored if this is set \ntrue\n.  Default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nignore_selections\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nIgnores selections in the view.  If this is set, \nmulti_select\n and \nhighlight_selections\n will be treated as \nfalse\n regardless of their actual value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwrap\n\n\ninteger\n\n\nDefine the allowable size in px to wrap lines at.  By default wrapping is not used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolor_scheme\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThe color scheme (tmTheme) file you would like to use.  By default the current color scheme file is used, or the the alternate default color scheme if defined in the setting \nalternate_scheme\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclipboard_copy\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nCopy html to the clipboard after generation. Default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbrowser_print\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nWhen opening in the web browser, also open the browser\ns print dialog. This will be ignored if \nview_open\n is \ntrue\n.  Default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nview_open\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nOpen HTML in a Sublime Text tab instead of the web browser.  Default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno_header\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nDo not display file name, date, and time at the top of the HTML document. Default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate_time_format\n\n\nstring\n\n\nString denoting the format for date and time when displaying header.  Please see Python\ns documentation on \ntime.strftime\n for detailed info on formatting syntax.  Default is \n%m/%d/%y %I:%M:%S\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow_full_path\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nShow full path for filename when displaying header. Default is \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsave_location\n\n\nstring\n\n\nPath to save html file.  If the file is wanted in the same file as the original, use \n.\n.  Otherwise, use the absolute path to where the file is desired.  If there is an issue determining where to save the file, or the path does not exist, the OS temp folder will be used. Default is \nNone\n (use temp folder).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime_stamp\n\n\nstring\n\n\nConfigure the time stamp of saved html when using \nsave_location\n.  To remove time stamps, just set to an empty string \n.  Please see Python\ns documentation on \ntime.strftime\n for detailed info on formatting syntax.  Default is \n_%m%d%y%H%M%S\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoolbar\n\n\narray of strings\n\n\nOption to display a toolbar with to access features in a generated HTML.  This setting is an array of keywords that represent the icons in the toolbar to show.  Valid keywords include \ngutter\n, \nprint\n, \nplain_text\n, \nannotation\n, \ntheme\n, and \nwrapping\n.  Toolbar will appear when you mouse over the upper right corner of the window of the generated html.  Default enables all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilter\n\n\nstring\n\n\nFilters to use on the theme\ns colors.  The string is a sequence of filters separated by \n;\n.  The accepted filters are \ngrayscale\n, \ninvert\n, \nsepia\n, \nbrightness\n, \nglow\n, \nsaturation\n, \nhue\n, and \ncolorize\n.  \nbrightness\n and \nsaturation\n requires a float parameter to specify to what magnitude the filter should be applied at.  \nglow\n requires a float for intensity (usually something like .1 or .2 is sufficient).  \nhue\n and \ncolorize\n take a float that represents a degree.  \nhue\n shifts the hue via the degree given (can accept negative degrees); hues will wrap if they extend past 0 degrees or 360 degrees.  Example: \nfilter\n: \nsepia;invert;brightness(1.1);saturation(1.3);\n.  Default is \n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshift_brightness\n\n\nbool\n\n\nThis setting shifts the entire theme\ns brightness if a background color\ns luminance is below the global setting \nbg_min_lumen_threshold\n.  This was added to solve an issue that I had when copying dark themes into an outlook email; if a html span had a background that was too dark, the foreground would just be white.  This allows me to not have to worry about how dark the theme is, and probably serves very little use besides that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to bind a command to a key combination etc., the same settings as above can be used.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n{\n\n    \nkeys\n:\n \n[\nctrl+alt+n\n],\n\n    \ncommand\n:\n \nexport_html\n,\n\n    \nargs\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nnumbers\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n        \nwrap\n:\n \n900\n,\n\n        \nbrowser_print\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n        \nmulti_select\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n        \ncolor_scheme\n:\n \nPackages/ExportHtml/ColorSchemes/Print-Color.tmTheme\n,\n\n        \nstyle_gutter\n:\n \nfalse\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen viewing the HTML in your web browser, regardless of the gutter settings, the gutter can be toggled to show or be hidden using the toolbar.\n\n\nExporting BBCode\n\n\nExportHtml can also export selected code as BBCode for posting in forums. Exporting BBCode is very similar to exporting HTML code.\n\n\nIf adding a command to the settings file, it goes under the \nbbcode_panel\n setting.  These configurations will appear under the \nExport to BBCode: Show Export Menu\n command palette command.\n\n\n// Define configurations for the drop down export menu\n\n\nbbcode_panel\n:\n \n[\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nTo Clipboard - Format as BBCode\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nnumbers\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n            \nmulti_select\n:\n \ntrue\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the command is the key value, and then you add the parameters you wish to specify.  You can use any combination of settings below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumbers\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nDisplay line numbers in the gutter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmulti_select\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nIf multiple regions are selected in a document, only export what is under those selections.

If this is set, \nmulti_select\n will be treated as \nfalse\n regardless of its actual value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolor_scheme\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThe color scheme (tmTheme) file you would like to use.  By default the current color scheme file is used, or the the alternate default color scheme if defined in the setting \nalternate_scheme\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclipboard_copy\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nCopy BBCode to the clipboard after generation. Default is \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nview_open\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nOpen txt file of BBCode in a Sublime Text tab.  Default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno_header\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nDo not display file name, date, and time at the top of the HTML document. Default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to bind a command to a key combination etc., the same settings as above can be used.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n{\n\n    \nkeys\n:\n \n[\nctrl+alt+n\n],\n\n    \ncommand\n:\n \nexport_bbcode\n,\n\n    \nargs\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nnumbers\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n        \nmulti_select\n:\n \ntrue\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotations (HTML only)\n\n\nAnnotations are comments you can make on selected text.  When the HTML is generated, the selected text will be underlined, and when the mouse hovers over them, a tooltip will appear with your comment.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use annotations, you must enter into an \nAnnotation Mode\n.  This puts your file in a read only state.  At this point, you can select text and create annotations using the annotation commands provided.  When you leave the \nAnnotation Mode\n, all annotations will be lost.  So you must print before leaving annotation mode.\n\n\nYou can access the annotation commands from the command palette or from the context menu.\n\n\nThe commands are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Annotation Mode\n\n\nTurn annotation mode on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable Annotation Mode\n\n\nTurn annotation mode off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotate Selection\n\n\nAnnotate the given selection (no multi-select support currently).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete Annotation(s)\n\n\nDelete the annotation region the the cursor resides in (multi-select support).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete All Annotations\n\n\nDelete all annotation regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Annotation Comment\n\n\nShow the annotation comment of the region under the cursor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can navigate the annotations in the generate HTML by using a jump table.  You can show the jump table at any time by selecting the annotation button in the toolbar.  You can also click any annotation to show the jump table as well.  If it gets in the way, you can dock it in a different location.\n\n\n\n\nSettings File options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalternate_scheme\n\n\nstring or false\n\n\nDefines a default theme to be used if a theme is not specified in a command.
