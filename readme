For Sublime Text 2: Creates a text command to save the current file as 
HTML, using your selected theme's colours.

It will be saved in the current folder. If the file is named 'something.ext' 
then the new file will be called 'something_ext_parsed.html'.

If you select an area before pressing your key-binding then the selection 
only will be saved, and named 'something_ext_part.html'.

Save the file/text as 'PrintHtml.py' in your User folder.

To create a key-binding, add the following to your User key-bindings file:

{ "keys": ["ctrl+alt+n"], "command": "print_html" },

but you can choose any key-sequence. Andy.
